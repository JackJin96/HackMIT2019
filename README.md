# AFAR: Assisted Focus Audio Reviewer

AFAR (Assisted Focus Audio Reviewer) is a web application that transcribes in real-time audio inputs from a microphone attached to a speaker so that the user can read follow along with the speaker while wearing noise-canceling headphones to filter out the noise distractions. This allows the user to be either in a separate, distraction-free room or in the same room as the speaker but able to focus on the lecture.
